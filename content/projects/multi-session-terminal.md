Dill, in the Arvo kernel, supports multiple sessions, but the current Urbit terminal client only uses one session.  To make the Urbit command-line more usable, the client should support multiple sessions too.  This work would entail writing a new process that can connect to Urbit and have Dill spawn a new session.

This would improve Urbit's developer experience and open up more possibilities for terminal user interfaces for users who prefer the command line.
