The "Fine" remote scry protocol will form the foundation of scalable content distribution in Urbit, by allowing many subscriber ships to read data efficiently from a publisher ship without incurring excessive load on the publisher, which is the bottleneck.

Solid-state publications can be implemented without this by using the existing Ames protocol to publish data, the way Urbit works now -- this will achieve the reliability and developer experience goals of solid-state publications, but not the scaling goals.

Many of the other networking projects build on top of Fine to bring the system closer to the solid-state, referentially transparent future that Urbit promises.

Fine has been implemented and tested some on a testnet, but it will need more testing before deployment.  It affects both Arvo and Vere and requires a Kelvin bump.
