For smaller devices or existing programs, it would be good to be able to speak the Urbit network protocol by importing a library, `libames`.  This should probably be written in C to make it easy to embed into programs written in other languages.

`libames` would aid in integrating Urbit with other systems, writing iOS clients, and allowing Urbit to be used in internet-of-things applications.
