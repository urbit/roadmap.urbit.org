Applications often have bugs when a peer breaches.  Modifying the userspace/kernelspace API to give Gall agents clearer information about breaches should improve application reliability and developer experience.  One proposal is to add a new `+on-rift` arm to Gall agents to ensure they are always informed about breached peers.

A PR for `+on-rift` can be found here:
