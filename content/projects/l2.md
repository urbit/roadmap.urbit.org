When [Azimuth](https://urbit.org/docs/azimuth/azimuth) (Urbit's PKI) was first
deployed on the Ethereum blockchain in 2019, gas prices (transaction fees) were
low, and so the cost of spawning planets, performing factory resets, etc, was
trivial. Since then, gas prices have increased significantly, making Urbit
planets prohibitively expensive.

To solve this issue, an L2 (layer two) solution was developed. Raw transactions
are batched together and posted in bulk to the blockchain without validation.
Individual ships on the network receive the raw transactions from Azimuth,
validate them, process them, and update their PKI state locally. This approach
was termed "naive rollups", and it reduces individual transactions costs by many
multiples, usually 65x or more for a sufficiently large batch.

Transactions are submitted to a "roller", which any ship on the network can run.
They can set their own posting frequency, user whitelist, transaction
allowances, etc. Tlon runs a roller which allows anyone to submit up to 25
transactions per week, for free. [Bridge](https://bridge.urbit.org/) uses their
roller by default.

Along with the infrastructural changes, a number of UX changes were also made to
Bridge. In particular, Star owners can easily generate invite codes which can be
used to claim a planet by simply visiting a URL. The [master
ticket](https://urbit.org/using/id/hd-wallet) and network keys can be downloaded
and the planet booted immediately, without having to deal with an Ethereum
wallet at all. This makes the on-boarding process much smoother for new users.
