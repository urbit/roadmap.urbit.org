A far-out proposal is to have the runtime perform serialization, packetization, encryption, and congestion control, instead of Arvo.  This would be a big conceptual shift and has risks associated with that, but it would massively increase network bandwidth and it would be a big step toward making Ames a true overlay network, by making it more transport-agnostic.

Here is a rough spec, which could use some updating:

Alternatives to this project include using a scry-based effect system in Vere, which smart runtimes could retrieve in batches.  This might dovetail with new timer and event deferral systems too.
