`~palfun-foslup` wrote a whole suite of improvements to the terminal.  This opened up a lot of opportunities for better developer experience and terminal-based user experience.  It also enabled new classes of terminal-based applications, including text editors, MUDs, and textual interfaces to groups and DMs.
