A version of Hoon with a dependent type system could make the type system easier to understand, improving developer experience.  It also has potential to improve the userspace/kernelspace interface, by making it more ergonomic and composable.  Seeing a demo would help other core devs understand this research.  If the compiler for this were written in Hoon, then other core devs could even start experimenting with dependent language features themselves.
