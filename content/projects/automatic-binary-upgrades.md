Arvo updates itself over the air, but current Vere does not.  We should let the binary update itself by downloading a new version and replacing itself with that, instead of forcing the user to run terminal commands to stay up to date.  This would be a big step along the way to Zero-click maintenance.

It might need support from Arvo and userspace, so that the user can click "ok" in the web UI to upgrade the binary.
