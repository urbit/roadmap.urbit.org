This week was focused on release efforts.  `~palfun-foslup`'s long-anticipated [terminal improvements](https://roadmap.urbit.org/project/terminal-improvements) were finally released.  In addition, a lot of work has been going into improving the release process itself.  Expect a more detailed description of what's going on with releases from UF soon.

[Doccords](https://roadmap.urbit.org/project/doccords), the next kernel release, is slotted for a week from Tuesday.  Work continues to progress on Kelvin shims (see [new commits](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/6104#commits-pushed-c009d90)), solid-state subscriptions, and [pointer compression](https://roadmap.urbit.org/project/pointer-compression-8gb-loom) to enable an 8GB loom.
