This week's Tuesday releases included an improvement to Ames's publisher backpressure system that should improve performance for large groups.  Event log truncation was also officially released to the network, so if your urbit is using a lot of disk space, go ahead and run `/path/to/pier/.run chop` to reclaim it.

This week there has also been a lot of discussion about how to resolve a long-standing issue with Eyre, Urbit's webserver, where users need to refresh webpages with long-standing HTTP connections to their Urbit.

Here are some links to discussions, proposals, and code:
- [Original GitHub Issue](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/issues/6311)
- [Fix](https://github.com/pkova/reconnect-test)
- [Description of Fix](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/issues/6311#issuecomment-1442643676)
- [Twitter Discussion](https://twitter.com/dachus_tiprel/status/1628783176897134595?s=20)
- [Original WebSockets Proposal](https://dachus-tiprel.tlon.network/proposal/websockets)
- [Later Non-WebSockets Proposal](https://dachus-tiprel.tlon.network/proposal/eyre-fix)  (`~dachus-tiprel` has since revised this further, building the same paradigm but in userspace, without changing Eyre)

`~mopfel-winrux` began work on a way for Urbit to control arbitrary hardware devices: [https://urbit.amadeobellotti.com/proposal/loch/loch-proposal].  This is exciting work that will enable internet-of-things applications and integrations with other devices, such as hardware crypto wallets.

`~watter-parter` began work on the runtime half of [a system that will allow Urbit to serve static webpages from a runtime cache](https://urbit.org/grants/eyre-scry), without running Nock or doing disk writes.  This will be an important scaling improvement for apps that serve content to the old web, such as `%studio`, `%blog`, along with any frontend-only app, such as `%uniswap`.
