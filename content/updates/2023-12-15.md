There haven't been many updates here in a long time, but that's because we've
been busy building.

In the middle part of the year we launched [Urbit Improvement
Proposals](https://github.com/urbit/UIPs) and much of our roadmap work was
directed there.

~rovnys-ricfer and I just put a concerted effort into bringing the roadmap up to
speed, and plan to continue keeping it updated on a more regular basis (although
probably not weekly). Here's what the latest update did:

* The Overview now reflects our current top priorities
* All major projects undertaken throughout the year are now added
* Current and Next Up projects are updated with as much detail as we have added

2024, here we come!
